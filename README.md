# **VoltStream: A Streaming Power Load Forecasting Framework**

VoltStream is a real-time power load forecasting framework built on Apache Spark and Kafka, designed for smart grid applications.
It integrates multi-source data — including real-time power measurements, weather information, and building attributes — to enhance forecasting accuracy.
The system implements distributed model training and streaming inference, enabling scalable, low-latency, and continuously updated energy predictions.
